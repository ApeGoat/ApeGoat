# About Me
### I'm Sammy
At the moment, my personal goal is to create a portfolio of coding-related projects which can serve as a comprehensive display of my interests and abilities as a software developper.
I'm currently familiarizing with GitHub as a collaboration platform for these projects, and I'd like to develop as many coding skills as I can over the next few months.
